            <h2>Operation "Y" and Shurik's Other Adventures</h2>
            <p>
              The film consists of three short stories, united by the figure of
              the main character Shurik - a rustic, but resilient and
              resourceful student. Shurik is distinguished by the fact that he
              constantly gets into some unusual stories, but thanks to his easy
              attitude to life, he turns any situation into a fun adventure.
